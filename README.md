![Database-Driven Static Web Site](Thumbnail.jpg)

## Abstract
So you need to build a website that can respond within a second regardless of the number of users and be updated almost instantly without delay in response to underlying database changes.  Those requirements are relatively easy to meet, but you get the additional requirement that the cost must be the absolute minimum.  So what you need is a database-driven static web app.  That might sound like an oxymoron, but with Azure Static Web Apps and some easy-to-build coding, you can meet all of these requirements with the bean counters barely even noticing.
